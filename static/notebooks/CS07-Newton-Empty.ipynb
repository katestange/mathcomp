The Sage docs for the various options for real and complex numbers are [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings_numerical/index.html).  For now, just take a moment to internalize the fact that there's no way to keep a real number in a computer.\n",

    "And now, create a plot of the complex plane where each position is coloured by which root of the polynomial you approach with Newton iteration.  Let's stick to three roots.  So colour the location x+iy green (or whatever) if running Newton iteration with initial value x+iy approaches root 1, blue if it approaches root 2, etc.  Sage is probably *not* the right tool for this type of sophistocated plotting, so I'd do the simplest thing and fill a matrix with the results and then `plot(matrix, cmap='viridis')`.  But if you want to use an excellent tool for this, you could look into [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)."
