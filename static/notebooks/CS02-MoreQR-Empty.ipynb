    "## Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "My simple functions are easy to read, but Sage's plotting capabilities are fairly minimal.  Fortunately, Sage is built on python, which has libraries for lots of stuff.  In particular, `matplotlib` is a very powerful graphing library for many different tasks.  So we're going to learn the basics of how to use that inside Sage, when we want to make prettier pictures.  A few basic facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sage objects are a Sage type, although they are generated using matplotlib under the hood.\n",
    "2. To make a sage graphics object into a matplotlib object, you can use the command `.matplotlib()`.\n",
    "3. To use matplotlib python plots directly, you need to load it: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.\n",
    "4. Sometimes there are type issues, so you may need to cast a Sage real number to a float, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to go from matplotlib to sage objects, so it's easier, if you want lots of functionality, to just simply work in matplotlib.  Let's convert what we were doing into matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The gist of matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fresh canvas**:  Start a new plot with `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` â€” this creates a figure and one set of axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Figure vs. Axes**:  A matplotlib plot lives inside a **figure** (the page/canvas, usually called `fig`), which contains one or more **axes** (the actual plotting regions, usually called `ax`).  You can pass `fig` and `ax` around and add content to them.  You mostly work with `ax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Basic drawing**:  Add simple things like points, lines, etc. with `ax.plot(...)`.  This modifies the given axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Artists**:  More complex objects (circles, polygons) are called *artists*.  Some have methods that both create and add them (e.g. `ax.text(...)`).  Others need two steps: create the artist (e.g. `circle = plt.Circle(...)`) and then put it on the axes (e.g. `ax.add_patch(circle)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Styling and layout**:  At the end, you can adjust aspect ratio, axis visibility, limits, labels, etc. by modifying ax (e.g. `ax.set_aspect(\"equal\")`, `ax.axis(\"off\")`).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a demonstration and reference, here's the commands at the top of the sheet re-done via matplotlib.  Read these over carefully."

One option is modify code you had previously to allow for a parameter giving the range of lines to draw.  Or you can cut-n-paste.  In nice code you plan to keep, it's best practice to avoid repetition, so nicer to make a more versatile function and, if you like, create wrappers (quick functions that set certain parameters before calling).
