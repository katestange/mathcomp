    "# Case Study 5:  Primes in Sage\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sage, there are commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `prime_pi(x)` - the prime counting function $\\pi(x) = \\# \\{ p < x : p \\mbox{ prime} \\}$.\n",
    "2. `is_prime(x)`\n",
    "3. `nth_prime(n)` - e.g. `nth_prime(1)` gives `2`\n",
    "4. `li(x)` - the logarithmic integral $\\operatorname{li}(x) := \\int_2^x \\frac{dt}{\\ln t}$\n",
    "5. `ln(x)` - the natural log\n",
    "6. `primes(x)` - iterator of primes up to x\n",
    "7. `list(primes(x))` - list of primes up to x\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator doesn't (necessarily) hold all its elements in memory at once, but can produce them on demand.  There's no random access, you can only get the elements in order.  Both an iterator and a list can be used in a for loop:  `for p in primes(10)` is just like `for p in list(primes(10))`.  But they are different concepts:  one is a list completely in memory, the other an object that produces outputs when called.  Iterators can be much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of primes $\\pi(x)$ is approximated by $\\frac{x}{ln(x)}$ or $\\operatorname{li}(x)$ where $\\ln$ is the natural logarithm.  Create a graph that shows these three quantities for $x$ from $0$ to $10000$ then $100000$ etc.  You'll want to just use `plot( f(x), xmin = a, xmax = b)` syntax, keeping in mind you can add graphics objects and set colours to differentiate them.  Which approximation is the best?"
