# SageMath

Installing Sage on macOS and Linux is fairly easy, and Windows is more challenging.

You have two basic options: install an existing executable file, or compile from source. The latter produces a more efficient/optimized version of Sage on your machine, but it is more complicated and time-consuming. I strongly recommend you carefully read and adhere to the installation instructions *(seriously â€” a stitch in time!)*.

If you install from source, expect significant compile time. In this case, you can opt to set your machine up for development, which means contributing your own code to Sage. You are welcome to do this, but it is certainly not required, and you can do it at a later time.

If you have trouble installing Sage, your most expedient option nowadays is to ask ChatGPT for help. You can paste in error messages, etc., and it can help you troubleshoot.

Graduate students have access to Sage at [sage.colorado.edu](https://sage.colorado.edu/) via their Identikey.
