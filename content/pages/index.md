## Welcome to Math 8114: Topics in Number Theory

You will be bringing your laptop to class every day; this is a workshop, not lecture, course.

Before the first day of class, please try to get [Sage installed on your own machine](sagemath.html). This is the most reliable option. Sage is also available to graduate students at [sage.colorado.edu](https://sage.colorado.edu/).
